# soccer-bot — RoboCup humanoid software stack

A **complete, layered** reference implementation of the RoboCup Humanoid software
architecture described in `docs/architecture/`. Every layer of the real system is
present and wired through the **same** package boundaries, `ros2_control`
abstraction, and DevOps flow used on the full robot.

> The robot model is currently a **minimal placeholder** — one `neck_pan` joint ·
> one monocular camera · one IMU — deliberately the smallest thing that still
> exercises **every layer**.

Growing the placeholder into the full humanoid is a matter of expanding the URDF
and policies, **not** re-architecting. Actuation is provided by **Robostride**
quasi-direct-drive actuators that close the impedance loop **onboard** (MIT mode):
the Jetson streams full MIT setpoints (`q*, qd*, kp, kd, τ_ff`) to an **STM32
Master** (safety + aggregation) over USB-CDC, which bridges to the actuators over
CAN. See [docs/architecture/jetson_master_protocol.md](docs/architecture/jetson_master_protocol.md).

## The layered architecture (frequency domains)

| Layer                  | Rate               | Package(s)                                                         | Runs on          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| L5 Mission             | ~2 Hz              | `game_controller_bridge`                                           | Jetson           |
| L4 Strategy            | 5–20 Hz            | `soccer_strategy`, `soccer_teamcomm`                               | Jetson           |
| L3 Perception          | 30–60 Hz           | `soccer_perception`                                                | Jetson           |
| L3/L2 Localization     | 30–60 / 100–400 Hz | `soccer_localization` (MCL + EKF)                                  | Jetson           |
| L1 Whole-body control  | 50–100 Hz          | `soccer_control` (MPC + residual RL)                               | Jetson           |
| L0 Real-time actuation | actuator onboard   | `soccer-firmware/` submodule (STM32 Master/Slave → Robostride CAN) | STM32 + actuator |

The **cardinal rule**: slow cognition (vision, strategy) must never block the fast balance
loop. Each layer degrades gracefully — a crash in perception can't stall the actuator's
onboard control loop.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Build the ROS 2 workspace (ROS 2 Jazzy)
cd ros2_ws
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash

# 2. Bring up ONE robot in simulation (sim hardware interface)
ros2 launch soccer_bringup robot.launch.py robot_name:=robot_1 sim:=true

# 3. Bring up a 2-robot scrimmage with the GameController bridge
ros2 launch soccer_bringup team.launch.py num_robots:=2

# Or use Docker for the whole multi-robot sim:
cd deploy/compose && docker compose -f sim.compose.yaml up
```
